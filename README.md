# Final Course Project - Distributed

Project completed during the fifth session of my computer science program.

This is the end-of-session project, a Blazor application.

Operates with Kafka/Kubernetes/Docker.

## Specifications:

To demonstrate that your server can be clustered, the only constraint of the application will be that at least 2 users can interact together. Thus, if one of the users connects to one node of the cluster and another connects to the second node, both should be able to use the functionalities as if there were only one server.
